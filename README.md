# Tema-4-oppgave

In this project we have a collapsible menu that hides 5 applications: 
- Todo List,
- Slideshow,
- Contact Form,
- Sortable Table,
- Quiz.

All these applications open in their own pages when chosen on the navbar.

The project is made with the help of Vue.js.

Router and Store have been applied.
